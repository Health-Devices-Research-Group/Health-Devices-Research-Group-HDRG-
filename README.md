# Computer Analysis Research Group (CARG)

The Computer (Data) Analysis Research Group at the University of Ottawa is working on innovating new healthcare devices that can be used in hospitals and retirement homes. The group was formed in 2016 and until now we have been lucky to work with two visiting professors/researchers, two postdoctoral fellows and more than 10 graduate students. The group is performing research in the following areas:  
- Posture and fall detection system using 3D motion sensors  
- People identification system using 3D motion sensors  
- Breathing rate estimation using radars  

An important objective of our group is to conduct research in close collaboration with industry and other academic groups.
